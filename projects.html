Check out pictures from my most recent Data Analysis Project at the Nonprofit Arts and Scraps located in Detroit, Michigan.
As a Data team we analyzed program evaluation data sources and work towards building automated tools for data collection.
We also presented clients with data visualizations/conclusions for grant purposes and train clients to use the software for future use.
